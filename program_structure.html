                ThesisPathways is a structured, one-on-one research mentorship program designed for
                high school and undergraduate students. Each student works closely with a PhD/MD-level
                mentor to complete an original research project or a literature review and submit it
                to a student research journal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The program consists of <strong>20 individual 30-minute sessions</strong>, conducted
                remotely, with clearly defined milestones to ensure progress, accountability, and
                successful completion.

                    <h3>Original Research Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        In an original research project, students investigate a novel question by
                        collecting or analyzing data. This may include experiments, simulations,
                        surveys, interviews, or analysis of open-source datasets.

                        <li>Involves data collection or data analysis</li>
                        <li>Generates new insights on a focused question</li>

                    <h3>Literature Review</h3>
                    <p>
                        In a literature review, students synthesize and critically evaluate existing
                        research on a specific topic. Rather than collecting new data, students analyze
                        published studies to identify trends, gaps, and future directions.

                        <li>Identifies debates, patterns, and gaps in research</li>
                        <li>Common in humanities, social sciences, and theory-heavy fields</li>

                        <strong>Example:</strong> Reviewing existing studies on climate anxiety among adolescents.

                Both project types are rigorous, mentor-guided, and eligible for submission to student
                research journals. Students and mentors select the format that best aligns with the
                student’s interests, experience level, and academic goals.
