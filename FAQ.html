                    <p>ThesisPathways is a fully remote mentorship program, and students do not work in institutional or university laboratories through the program. However, depending on the project, students may choose to conduct simple, safe, and independent experiments on their own. Any hands-on activities must be appropriate for a home or school setting, follow safety guidelines, and do not require specialized lab equipment. Mentors focus on guiding research design, analysis, and interpretation rather than supervising in-person lab work.</p>
