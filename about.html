            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                ThesisPathways was founded by a PhD graduate from Yale University. The company was started out of a passion for guiding curious students. Inspired by her own research journey and the amazing mentors she's had in her life, she wanted to create a program where high school and undergraduate students could explore original research, receive personalized mentorship, and develop skills that open doors to college and meaningful careers.
